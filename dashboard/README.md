# Dashboard

This is a small extension to the main API to make it easier to manage internals of the app

### Setup

```sh
npm i
npm run build
```

Next time you start RT-CV you can access the dashboard via the / route

### Development

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```

You now have a life development server running on localhost:3000 that proxies all /api routes to localhost:4000/api (the RT-CV api)
